# Read Me. --- Kristian Joten Andersen ---

This code is created for the course FYS-STK4155 "Data analysis and machine learning"
at UiO, fall semester 2019.

Some comments:
- The code has not been coded with classes. This may make the code slightly less structured
  and is something I plan on changing for the coming projects.

- The code requires a directory called "figs" to store plots and images

- The file called "project1_main.py" is the main executable code. Change flage True/False
  to run specific parts of the code.
